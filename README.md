# Description
Adds a button to the message view in Thunderbird. Clicking on the button copies the domain (everything after the "@" symbol) into your clipboard.

# Installation
Git clone the repository and change directory into the cloned repo.
Then execute:
```bash
zip CopyDomain.xpi manifest.json background.js LICENSE
```
This creates the zipped file CopyDomain.xpi.

Open Thunderbird and install the addon.
